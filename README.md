## Changes compared to UML
I had to make A LOT of changes compared to my UML with basically one reason: I didn't know any better at the time of making my UML.
When I created my UML I thought the only to switch between pages was basically using Activities because I had never used/heard of Fragments before. So there are many differences between my UMLs and my final Applications "front-end classes" (the classes that are responsible for handling the front end). The rest of the classes stayed pretty much the same but I had to add a userCharacterRef because the way I intended to do it was complicated if not impossible. Of course some functions in my classes differentiate from the ones defined in the UML but that's because when developing it I just noticed how unpractical some of my ideas were.
